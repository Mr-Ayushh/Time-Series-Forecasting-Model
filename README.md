# Time Series Forecasting Model

This project implements a time series forecasting model using Python to predict future values based on historical data. The model aims to provide insights into trends and patterns in the data for better decision-making.

## Overview

Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, including finance, sales forecasting, and resource management. This project utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict future outcomes.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Handle missing values and outliers as necessary.

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose appropriate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, etc.).
   - Train the model using historical data.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
   - Plot forecasted values along with confidence intervals.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Statsmodels or Prophet:** For time series forecasting.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Ayushh/Time-Series-Forecasting-Model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Time-Series-Forecasting-Model
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Run the Python script:
